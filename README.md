# stdOUT5
KDE Plasma 5 port of STDOUT plasmoid

This plasmoid needs an updated version of <a href=https://github.com/Jacobtey/qml-applauncher>qml-applauncher</a>.

It can be used bash scripts from folder "scripts" (or make your own one) just inserting path to them into the fields in the plasmoid settings window. 

It's a good idea to set an update interval for hard tasks not too small.
