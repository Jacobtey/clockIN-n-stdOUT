# clockIN-n-stdOUT
KDE Plasma 5 port of the modified famous MINIMAL CLOCK and STDOUT plasmoids in one flacon

This plasmoid needs an updated version of qml-applauncher.

It can be used bash scripts from folder "scripts" (or make your own one) just inserting path to them into the fields in the plasmoid settings window. 

It's a good idea to set an update interval for hard tasks not too small
